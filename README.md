# SizeUp

## About

The real [SizeUp](https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) app costs $13,
[Stay](https://cordlessdog.com/stay/) app costs $15, but all I need is to
automatically arrange the windows of those long run applications.

## Usage

Type `make run` to try it, `make install` to build a **sizeup.app** and copy
into **/Applications**.  If you use [BetterTouchTool](http://www.boastr.net/),
you can assign a hotkey for the `sizeup.sh` script to invoke the app.
